1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    I would want to use a remote repository to share changes with others and collaborate on multi-developer projects.

2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I might want to always pull changes manually because I may not want to update my local files with the up-to-date version on the remote.

3. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you use one instead of another?

    branches: happen (are created) on a single repository
    cloning: involves taking an existing repo and making one just like 	it (either local > local and/or remote > local)
    fork: cloning only from an existing github repo to another github 	repo

4. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    The benefit of having a copy of the last known state of a remote locally provides
    a way to resolve any conflicts of a merge between two versions of updates before
    making a commit and pushing to the VCS.

5. How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier, and what would be harder?
