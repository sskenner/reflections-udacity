Reflect: Using a remote repository
Use the following reflection prompt:

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

My most common use of remote repositories is when I'm collaborating with
other people on a project.  I also use them when I want to share my code
with someone, even if they just want to see my code and not contribute to
it.  I also sometimes use them when I want to be able to edit code from
multiple different computers and keep the code up-to-date on all the
computers.  Also, remotes can be a good way to keep a backup of my work.

When you're finished committing your changes, click "Next" to see how to pull those changes to your own computer.

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Now that you've both pushed changes to GitHub, and pulled changes from GitHub, add the following question and your thoughts on it to your reflections file:

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I like pulling changes manually because that way, when I'm working on code, it doesn't change without me expecting it.  For example, if I know the new version of some code is broken, I might not want to pull that change until I the bug is fixed.

You may also want to commit and push your changes. When you're finished, click "Next" and Sarah will go over what to do if you want to share your changes to a repository and you don't have permission to modify the original.
